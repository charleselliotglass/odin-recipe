        <h2>Recipe Summary</h2>
          <p class="summary">Enjoy a delicious salmon from your home with this easy-to-follow recipe!</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 10 oz salmon</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><em>Steps</em>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">Press salmon fillets between paper towels to dry surfaces thoroughly. 
                Season on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li class="step">In a large stainless, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until 
                shimmering. Reduce heat to medium-low, then add a salmon fillet, skin side down. 
                Press firmly in place for 10 seconds, using the back of a flexible fish spatula, to prevent the
                skin from buckling. Add remaining fillets one at a time, pressing each with spatula for 10 seconds, 
                until all fillets are in the pan.</li>
            <li class="step">Cook, pressing gently on back of fillets occasionally to ensure good contact with skin, until skin 
                releases easily from pan, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li class="step">Using spatula and a fork, flip salmon fillets and cook on second side for 15 seconds, then transfer 
                to a paper towelâ€“lined plate to drain. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
